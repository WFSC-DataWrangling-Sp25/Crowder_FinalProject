# Crowder_FinalProject

Final project for Data Wrangling in R

# Summary of this Repository

This repo is made to hold the data that will be used for the final project of Data Wrangling in R (Ellen Bledsoe's class at University of Arizona). This will be where the final is created and stored.

## Data Structure of this Repository

The expected sub-directory structure will be based on the example shown in class. It will have a scripts folder to hold the assignment, a data_raw folder to hold the raw/original data, a data_clean folder to hold the modified data, a documents folder to keep the information, and an outputs folder to hold the visuals and other images created from this project.

## The Data's Reproducibility

The original data that I downloaded is in the data_raw folder. It hasn't been changed from download. All changes that edit the information/data is in the other files. In order to make it work, tidyverse needs to be loaded. Otherwise, the code should work fine with the Run All button.

## Weeks Covered

The weeks that this project cover are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. I have put text of relevant weeks in the Script.Rmd file to make it easier to count. They are in the sentences part next to the hashtags.

## Meeting Expectations

The RMarkdown file reaches a length of 166 lines of code right now. There are brief explanations of what the code is doing at the top of each chunk.
