# Crowder_FinalProject

Final project for Data Wrangling in R

# The Data

The data that I am using is a text file called e249_Plant aboveground biomass data. I downloaded it off of EDI portal. It is from research focusing on General climate models (GCMs). The Biodiversity and Climate (BAC) experiment is focusing on the "direct and interactive effects" of plant species numbers, temperature, community composition, precipitation, and plant species numbers on "11 productivity, C and N dynamics, stability, and plant, microbe, and insect species abundances in CDR grassland ecosystems". I can only assume "CDR" means "Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research (CDR LTER)" because that's all I was able to find on it. This was created by David Tilman. I'm planning on using this data to create a bar graph showing mass of the 10 largest entries in lbs_per_acre and create a graph showing the total amount of each species.

# Summary of this Repository

This repo is made to hold the data that will be used for the final project of Data Wrangling in R (Ellen Bledsoe's class at University of Arizona). This will be where the final is created and stored.

## Data Structure of this Repository

The expected sub-directory structure will be based on the example shown in class. It will have a scripts folder to hold the assignment, a data_raw folder to hold the raw/original data, a data_clean folder to hold the modified data, a documents folder to keep the information, and an outputs folder to hold the visuals and other images created from this project.

## The Data's Reproducibility

The original data that I downloaded is in the data_raw folder. It hasn't been changed from download. All changes that edit the information/data is in the other files. In order to make it work, tidyverse needs to be loaded. Otherwise, the code should work fine with the Run All button.

## Weeks Covered

The weeks that this project cover are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. I have put text of relevant weeks in the Script.Rmd file to make it easier to count. They are in the sentences part next to the hashtags.

## Meeting Expectations

The RMarkdown file reaches a length of 166 lines of code right now. There are brief explanations of what the code is doing at the top of each chunk.

# Where to Find
